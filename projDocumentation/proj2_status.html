            <h3>Author: Charles Bonoan</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Progress Pictures: </li>

                <p>In order to get to the login page of the application, the user would have the Odin's
                    server URL and go to my student page (cbonoan). Once my partner and I finish testing on our 
                    localhost, we will put it up on Odin. Then once the user inputs their username and a room name, they 
                    will be taken to a chatroom that will look like the second screen shot, except the "Room" name would 
                    be filled out.
                </p>

                <li>Source Code Samples:</li>
                <img src="assets/serverStatus.PNG" alt=""><br>
                <p>This code, which is written in Python, will be the server side of our application. It will handle which
                    pages are shown for each URL path, and will handle socket events such as messages from users.
                </p><br>
                <img src="assets/clientStatus.PNG" alt=""><br>
                <p>This code sample shows the beginnings of the client side development. In the head of the HTML, you can see
                    three script tags. One for the Soocket.IO extension for JS, another for JQuery, and the third one will be 
                    the setting up of the client sockets. This will be written in the JavaScript language.
                </p>
                <p>Not including the HTML for the login page, I have written a little over 50 lines of code.</p>

                <li>Interesting feature:</li>
                <p>One interesting feature our application will have is that the user 1) will have their username displayed
                    when chatting in the chatroom, and 2) choose a chat room name that other users will be able to join.
                </p>

                <li>Completeness:</li>
                <p>I would say our project is about 20-25% complete.</p>
                <p>One interesting thing I learned is finding out that there was an extension for JavaScript that enables
                    socket creation and real-time communication. I never expected JavaScript to be used for anything else
                    besides website animation.
